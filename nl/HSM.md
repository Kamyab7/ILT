The IND is a crucial organization for anyone looking to immigrate to the Netherlands as an HSM. Not all companies can support relocation and sponsorship; only specific companies listed by the IND can apply for your relocation package.

- **IND Sponsorship List:** [Public Register of Recognised Sponsors](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors/public-register-regular-labour-and-highly-skilled-migrants)

### Sponsorship Details

Only companies that are part of the IND sponsorship list can sponsor your relocation. If your current employer is not on the list, they must partner with an enterprise service provider like [Employor](https://www.employor.com/). These companies are typically composed of HR specialists and lawyers who facilitate the sponsorship process.

**How It Works:**
1. **Contract with Employor:** Your non-listed employer contracts with Employor.
2. **Employor as Sponsor:** Employor becomes your official sponsor and signs a contract with you.
3. **Support and Transition:** Employor supports you until your original company is ready to sponsor you directly.
